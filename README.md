# Restaron Challenge

This is [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) based website designed for [Restarone](https://restarone.com/) coding challenge.

The challenge was initially set to be done on the [Violet Rails CRM](https://github.com/restarone/violet_rails) but due to some breaking change with CSS, I set up this repo and hosted the site on Github Pages, [here](https://restarone-challenge.netlify.app). I will hopefully create a PR on the CRM and help fix the bug since it's all open source.
